# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Preparation

Welcome to my DSA preparation repository! This repo contains solutions to various data structures and algorithms problems, organized topic-wise into separate folders for structured study and quick reference. Each folder focuses on a specific concept—such as arrays, strings, linked lists, trees, graphs, dynamic programming, and more—making it easy to target your practice and track your progress.

## Features

- Solutions to a variety of DSA problems for major topics
- Each topic has its own folder with relevant problems and solutions
- Problems sourced from popular competitive programming sites (LeetCode, GeeksforGeeks, HackerRank, etc.)
- Clean code and detailed explanations (where applicable)
- Continuously updated as new problems are solved

## How to Use

1. Browse to the folder of the topic you wish to practice.
2. Each folder contains problem files and a README with problem links and solution explanations.
3. Use this resource for interview preparation, contests, or mastering DSA concepts.

## Contributions

Suggestions and contributions are welcome! Submit an issue or pull request if you have problems to add, optimized solutions, or feedback for improvement.

Happy coding!
